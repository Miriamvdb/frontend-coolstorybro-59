# GOOD THINGS

    - I went to bed yesterday while having an error, I am so proud right now! :-)
    - Taking everything step by step, in a normal pace. I any case, don't want go too fast, to avoid making mistakes.
    - Taking enough breaks when my brain started work less. And after a while I was starting fresh again.
    - Use my own steps plan sheets (for backend, react and redux ). It helps me a lot to know if I've taken every step, because they are A LOT!
    - On the practise assessment: mainly on day 3 I've asked a lot of questions and I didn't hesitate (anymore :P), because it took me too much time.
    - When I'm doing CSS, I know that I'm doing a good job (or I think that I am doing a good job). Because then I think I have time left. Or is this more an improvement point? ;-)

# POINTS TO IMPROVE

    - I forgot my duck :-( But I have a photo of the big duck with the hearts (the one in the canteen), so I tried to explain my code to the duck on the photo.
    - Sometimes when I was stuck on one feature for long without finding a solution. What I can improve to move on earlier with another feature and take a look back later on the previous feature.
    - On the practise assessment: when a teacher help wasn't available, for example when a lot of classmates are having questions, I'll try to ask it on a classmate before.
    - What I can improve is to not to wait too long for a teachers help. It happended me on the practise assessment. Now I was stuck too long at feature 1 and feature 2, in total it took me 2 days, (included setting up the backend).
